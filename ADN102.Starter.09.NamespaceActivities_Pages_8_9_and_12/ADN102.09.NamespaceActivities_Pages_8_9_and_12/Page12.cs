//Create another file named AnotherProgram.cs.
//Within AnotherProgram.cs, include the following:
//The necessary using statement for System
//A namespace named myNamespace. Within this namespace add the following:
//A class named AnotherProgram
//Add a method within the class named printText that prints "Hello Earth!" to the console.
//Again within the AnotherProgram.cs file, create another namespace.
//call this namespace  'unique'.
//The namespace should have a class named 'myUniqueClass'that includes a method called 'uniquePrint'.
//The method should have a print statement that says 'I am a unique print statement'.
//Using the using keyword, make both of the namespaces from AnotherProgram.cs available to this file using aliases.
//Within the Main method here, call each of the methods from the namespaces in AnotherProgram.cs.
//Your final output should look similar to the following:
//Hello World!
//Hello Earth!
//I am a unique print statement.
