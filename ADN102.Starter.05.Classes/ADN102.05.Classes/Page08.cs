//In this exercise you will add some constructors to your Color Class:

//The Color class will expose four constructors

//a Default ctor which will make all values 0, except for the opacity which will be 255. This is the color solid Black.
//a ctor accepting a single integer. all four values will be set to the value supplied.
//a ctor accepting 3 integers. Reading the values as RGB, you will set the amount of
//      Red, Green and Blue to the supplied values, and opacity will be 255.
//a ctor accepting 4 integers. Same as above, but also accepts the opacity as a 4th parameter.
